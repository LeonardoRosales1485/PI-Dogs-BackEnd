# PI-Dogs-BackEnd
Front End of my personal project for coding bootcamp SoyHenry. I had to use the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Redux
- Node.js

# How to start on local
1- Open your terminal
2- write npm install
3- Wait for completation, then write npm start

This must be done for the <a href="https://github.com/LeonardoRosales1485/pi-dogs-front/">FrontEnd</a> of this project as well
