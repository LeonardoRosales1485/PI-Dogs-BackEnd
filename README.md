# PI-Dogs-BackEnd
Front End of my personal project for coding bootcamp SoyHenry. I had to use the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Redux
- Node.js

Also, all the dogs' information had to come from <a href="https://thedogapi.com/">The Dog API</a> and store in database the necessary information (such as all the dogs' temperaments and custom dogs inputed by user)

# How to start on local
1- Open your terminal
2- write npm install
3- Wait for completation, then write npm start

This must be done for the <a href="https://github.com/LeonardoRosales1485/pi-dogs-front/">FrontEnd</a> of this project as well

# Back End Known Issues

None at the moment of this version release

# What to do at this app

- You can search for dog's breed and find information about them!
- Filters by name and temperaments are available (It was a requirement for approbal not to use API endpoints).
- Sorting by weight and alphabetically (It was a requirement for approbal not to use API endpoints).
